Note: Replace GeekCredit :author_name :author_username :author_email geek-credit :package_description with their correct values in README.md, CHANGELOG.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, LICENSE.md, composer.json and other files, then delete this line. Tip: Use "Find in Path/Files" in your code editor to find these keywords within the package directory and replace all occurrences with your specified term.

This is where your description should go. Add a little code example so build can understand real quick how the package can be used. Try and limit it to a paragraph or two.
